context.clean_remove
--------------------

A Kodi add-on to delete a movie or episode or video cleanly, without leaving behind orphan files.

The kodi "Remove from library" is a nice feature, but only deletes the movie being played. After I started using it, I noticed that I had to manually delete the fanart, the nfo, subtitles, .actors, .trailers etc. Or instead ending up with a disk full of unused garbish.
So I came upo with this clean remove, a library removal tool that removes the media and all related files.

I have been using this for quite a while without any problems, so I am sharing it for public use. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
It will work well only if you kept the default naming terminology and paths for fanart and subtitles.

WARNING!!!
When you delete folder it will remove folder but not entries from library.

For  media types (movies, episodes, music videos and videos) this will delete the files with names that start same as media file name fanart, nfo and subtitles related to the media being removed form the library. Everything else on the same folder is not touched. Will delete folder with same name as file name. 

Optionally, if it was the last episode on the season/folder, it will delete the folder if it's empty.
