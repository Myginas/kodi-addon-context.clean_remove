context.clean_remove
--------------------

A Kodi add-on to delete a movie or episode or video cleanly, without leaving behind orphan files.

The kodi "Remove from library" is a nice feature, but only deletes the movie being played. After I started using it, I noticed that I had to manually delete the fanart, the nfo, subtitles, .actors, .trailers etc. Or instead ending up with a disk full of unused garbish.
So I came upo with this clean remove, a library removal tool that removes the media and all related files.

I have been using this for quite a while without any problems, so I am sharing it for public use. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
It will work well only if you kept the default naming terminology and paths for fanart and subtitles.

For media types such as movies, episodes, music videos, and videos, this will remove files whose names begin with the same prefix as the media file. Other files or folders in the same directory will remain unaffected. But if folder name match the file name then deletes folder.

Optionally, if it was the last episode on the season/folder, it will delete the folder if it's empty.
